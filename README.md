# ONNX_Conversion
Convert Tensorflow models to ONNX

Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) Runtime is an open source project that is designed to accelerate machine learning across a wide range of frameworks, operating systems, and hardware platforms. It enables acceleration of machine learning inferencing across all of your deployment targets using a single set of API. ONNX Runtime automatically parses through your model to identify optimisation opportunities and provides access to the best hardware acceleration available.

## Simple Tensorflow to ONNX tutorial for image classification using ResNet50

Run `onnx_tutorial.py` with `cat.jpg` for a simple guide to saving a tf model, converting to ONNX and comparing inference from both.
